Dear Ms. Schegel,

<p>I would like to express my interest in your software engineer opening. I think what your company does is phenomenal. By integrating efficiencies in the classroom, the potential for the student and teacher is limitless. Your product is exactly that, and what makes your opening exciting.</p>
<p>My education has been anything but traditional, and as we move into the future and find new avenues to foster education we are just beginning to see the possibilities. Haiku's business model revolves around that and I would love to join in your work.</p>
<p> I have been writing ruby on rails, html and css for some time now. The power of these established languages and the new ones that emerge everyday astound me. Development evolves on the daily, and the only hopes of staying current lies in self study and education.  I feel a position with your team would aid me learning and progressing in my knowledge through working with your established team.</P>
<p> I feel with my skills and experience, I would be an great fit on your team. If you would like to talk to me or schedule an interview, my number is (843)343-0992. I look forward to speaking with you, and thank you for your time.</P>

Best Regards,

John Hammond
