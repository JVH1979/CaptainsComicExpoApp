##The Story

Miklos Systems in Fairfax, VA. are looking for a jr. ruby/java developer to join their team. Miklos is a smaller shop with a tight, interconnected team. It seems the majority of their business comes from Government contracts, so security clearance is a must have. The position looks like it will be based in northern VA, with little option of working remote. The position definitely seems open to a developer just starting out. They weigh experience next to a degree, which is great. They work with Agile(which is awesome).
